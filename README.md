# What is this repository for?

I'm sharing my solutions to problemsets in codeforces website using C language.

Usually the file will be named same name as the problemset, and I'll try to always put the problemset url commented in the code source of its solution.

the git commit command will be commented this way "day/month/year hh:mm:ss" as the date time when I've done the problemset.

Any feedback that'll help me code better is very much appreciated!
